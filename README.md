## **Software Purpose**
We aim to computerize the different operations in travel agencies through an easy-to-use automated booking system. We propose to develop “Travel Agency Management System,” an application program for travel agencies which provides reservation services (flight booking, hotel accommodation and rental cars) to clients for transit. The fundamental objective of this software is to develop a fast, practical, and reliable automated working platform to evolve a communication system between clients and the agency. Travel Agency Management System will allow clients to select their dates, the start, and the end destination, and it will display rates of the trip. The clients can review their booking type and finalize the reservations at their convenience. This software is beneficial for both travel management agencies and clients in many ways. The design is to reduce the manual workload of travel services. One doesn’t need to visit the travel agency office to plan and book any trip through this software. It saves time for both the service providers and the clients. We intend to make the software flexible to add new features and modules to the system as per clients’ requirements.

## **Software Requirements**

1. Users will be able to login into the portal using their credentials. If the users provide invalid credentials, the login will be unsuccessful. 
2. Once the login is successful, a list of packages (flight, hotel accomodation and rental car) along with the cost offered by the travel agency, will be displayed to the user. 
3. According to the user’s requirement (booking type - flight, hotel accomodation and rental car), they can select features like book trip, view/print trip, modify trip, or cancel the trip. 
4. Users can book a trip based on the dates selected, start and end destination.
5. Users can also add passengers by entering the passenger details. 
6. Users can make use of special discount offers provided to them. 
7. The software program will display the total rates of the trip.
8. Users can make changes to the booked trip and the trip can be modified according to their preferences (add/remove passengers). 
9. Users can view and print their booked trip at any time of their convenience. 
10. Users can cancel their booked trip without any additional charges. 
11. Users can logout of the system once their needs are fulfilled.
