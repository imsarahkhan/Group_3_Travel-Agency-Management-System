PROBLEM STATEMENT

In the existing manual system of travel agencies, travellers lookout for travel agents to book tickets which is time-consuming, results in a lot of paper wastage, provides slow and poor service to the clients. There is a scope of human errors in reservations as well as the working and labour cost is high. To solve such issues of travel agencies, the whole travel agency management system requires to be automated using advanced technology. With the rapid development of technology, online booking services have become a highly convenient way for travellers to make reservations. 

SOFTWARE PURPOSE

We aim to computerize the different operations in travel agencies through an easy-to-use automated booking system. We propose to develop “Travel Agency Management System,” an application program for travel agencies which provides reservation facilities to clients for transit. The fundamental objective of this software is to develop a fast, practical, and reliable automated working platform to evolve a communication system between clients and the agency. Travel Agency Management System will allow clients to select their dates, the start, and the end destination, and it will display availability and rates of the trip. The clients can review all available seats and finalize their reservations. As soon as the booking is complete, clients can print the ticket at home. This software will manage the details of different routes, cities, bookings, and information about the clients. This software is beneficial for both travel management agencies and clients in many ways. The design is to reduce the manual workload of travel services. One doesn’t need to visit the travel agency office to plan and book any trip through this software. It saves time for both the service providers and the clients. We intend to make the software flexible to add new features and modules to the system as per clients’ requirements.
