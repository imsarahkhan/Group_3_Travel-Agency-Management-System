## Application Overview

Travel agents facilitate clients to find out best possible travel arrangements, recommend destinations and make arrangements for the hotel accommodations, car rentals, transportation, and tours for clients. The purpose of this project is to computerize the different operations in travel agencies through an easy-to-use automated booking system. 
Through this project, we intend to develop an application program for travel agencies which provides a convenient way for clients to book services such as flights, hotel accommodation and rental cars. 

* Users will be able to signup/login into the portal using their credentials and can log out of the system once their needs are fulfilled.
* View a list of packages (flight, hotel accommodation, and rental car) along with the cost offered by the travel agency
* Book flight, hotel accommodation, and rental car by using features like book trip, view/print trip, or cancel the trip.
* Users will be offered a discount if they choose more than one type of booking. 
* Users can view and print their booked trip at any time of their convenience.
* Users can cancel their booked trip without any additional charges.
